===============

*Presented at the Penn State Web 2011 Conference by Misha Kononov and Jim Campbell*

*June 13, 2011*

This is an example module that creates a "Book Reviews" content type and adds
some functionality surrounding it. Each commit is a "step" that was 
demonstrated at the presentation.
